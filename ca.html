			<h5>CAMPUS AMBASSADORS LEADERSHIP PROGRAM</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="left-col">
			<p>This year, HUWIB has revamped its previous Campus Ambassador program to allow for greater ownership and involvement from its Ambassadors. The revitalized, yearlong Campus Ambassador Leadership Program is personal and professional leadership development program for young women all over the world.</p>
			<p>One of the primary responsibilities of our Campus Ambassadors is to recruit as many girls as possible from their schools to attend IBC. Marketing the convention thoroughly is key to making the conference a success. Our Ambassadors develop creative campaigns that utilize social media, email, and word-of-mouth.</p>
			<p>Another aspect of the program is the Blog. Campus Ambassadors write bimonthly posts ranging from business op-eds to event summaries. The most engaging, thoughtful posts will be published in HUWIB's premiere Make it Happen Magazine.</p>
			<p>Finally, Ambassadors are required to plan and execute at least two events, one during the year for the women at their schools to encourage leadership development and engage with business ideas, and another during WIB Weekend, which will be a collaboration with other Campus Ambassadors. These events will bolster the enthusiasm and excitement for IBC throughout the year as well as engage young women internationally with issues currently being combated in the business world. Examples of campus events include company visits, panels, and dinners with local business professionals and professors.</p>
