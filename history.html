			<p>This year, we celebrate the decennial anniversary of the Intercollegiate Business Convention. As a milestone for ten years of growth in both size and opportunity, this year’s IBC will continue to be a forum for driven young women to discuss relevant and emerging trends, gain both concrete skills and applicable advice, and join a network of peers and inspiring professionals who will guide and engage them throughout their careers. We will also recognize a keynote speaker who demonstrates a passion for making an impact through exceptional business leadership, who drives positive change within her company, and who inspires women to continue to succeed, with the IBC Decennial Award.</p>

			        <div class="info">"When I chaired the 2nd ever Intercollegiate Business Convention in 2006, I had no idea it would reach the scale and depth of impact that it has, 10 years later. I remember one of the most rewarding aspects of planning that conference was working with a group of truly outstanding women, who were so passionate about launching an initiative that could empower other women within the business world. I couldn't be more proud to see that this passion continues to exists in the members of today. I look forward to continuing to see many more great things from this outstanding organization." - Andreea Akerele</div>

			        <div class="info">“Leading the 3rd Annual IBC was the greatest opportunity I had at Harvard. IBC allowed me to put into practice all the skills I was hoping to gain while at college, all while providing a forum for young women from all over the world to come together to learn from female leaders. The 3rd Annual IBC was our first International event- we had women flying in from multiple countries, along with representation from over 30 colleges, to hear from our speakers and meet like-minded peers. Our IBC team was really proud of the growing attendee list- as well as the global diversity. We also wanted to make our event really fun...so a lot of effort was put into those overflowing goody bags filled with samples and products from our sponsor and speaker companies!” - Colette Hinckley</div>

			        <div class="info">"IBC was one of my most memorable undergrad experiences, not only because of the inspiring women who spoke, but also because I continue to run into the women who attended at business school and at work even six years later! I can't wait to see what the group of women who have attended these conferences achieve in the years to come." - Ami Nash. IBC chair 2008.

			        <div class="info">“Being part of IBC – first as an attendee, later as the Chair of the 5th annual convention, and most recently as a panelist — shaped my career. The people I met, from peers to keynotes, inspired me to be more ambitious and have remained close friends and mentors. The experiences I had as Chair gave me the confidence to be bold and take risks early in my post-college career. And the opportunities I have had to return to IBC as an alumni have reminded me how lucky I am to be part of this amazing community.” - Tessa Lyons

			        <div class="info">"I don't spend time thinking about woe is me, I think about here’s a new challenge how am I going to overcome it, I try to take advantage of it…. there's ways to be a woman in business and win with it, and never feel like you’re at a disadvantage: - Julie Greenwald, Chairman and COO of Atlantic Records

					“Be glamorous, be stylish, rock the world.” - Farzana Haque, Global Head of Europe Telecom at Tata Consultancy Services

					“ I see so many young people, and women in business, when an opportunity comes their way, stepping back. And listing 10 reasons they aren’t perfectly ready. If you do that, you will miss 90% of the opportunities that come your way. You should be taking opportunities before you’re fully ready. By the time you’re fully ready, it is way too late, and there are many people equally qualified, if not more so, than you. And more importantly, hungrier, than you.” - Kat Cole, CEO Cinnabon</div>
