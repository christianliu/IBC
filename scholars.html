			<h3>MAKING IBC ACCESSIBLE</h3>
			<p>In our tenth year of IBC, we have renewed our mission to encourage collegiate women to discover new opportunities and achieve their goals. We firmly believe that every person should have access to the wonderful resources available at IBC, and our goal is to bring the IBC experience to as many people as possible.</p>
			<p>In concordance with this goal, we have launched a new and exciting program to help students around the world join us at the annual conference held this year on October 18, 2014 at the Hynes Convention Center, Boston. Based both on talent and on need, the IBC Scholarship will be awarded to several very bright and driven girls who do not have the means to attend IBC on their own. IBC Scholars will receive a monetary stipend that will reduce their costs and enable them to attend IBC this October. In addition to affording several girls the opportunity to attend IBC, the Scholars program will also encourage young women to support one another because the scholarship funds will be raised by Campus Ambassadors and other young women in business from around the world.</p>
			<p>We encourage anyone with the desire to attend IBC but without the means to do so to apply for this program. We will be searching for those applicants who show a genuine interest in the world of business and in the opportunities that IBC will offer, but who also portray the value of teamwork and the desire to empower and support other females in their business pursuits. Please enlighten us not only about your professional but also your personal passions, in order to give us a complete picture of yourself.</p>
			<p>The application will consist of general and logistical information, several short answers, and one long essay. Thank you for your interest in attending our conference, and we hope to see you there!</p>
